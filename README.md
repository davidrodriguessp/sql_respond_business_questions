# Using SQL to Respond Business Questions: Analyzing the Chinook Database
*Author: David Rodrigues. davidrodriguessp@hotmail.com. in/davidrodrigues. January, 2021.*

To build this project we used a database called Chinook. This is a fictitious database build to represent a digital music shop. It countains information like artists, songs and albums sold at the digital store. The database includes 11 tables with different data about the business.

The Chinook database was downloaded from [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/). 

In this repository you find two files:
- the database file called `chinook-unmodified.db`
- the Jupyter Notebook with the full code and results `sql_respond_business_questions.ipynb`
